# Reviewer Guide

CHAOSS Badging reviewers are expected to check an applicant's submissions against a review checklist.

For all submissions:
  - Make sure the Initial checks are met. These are the basic requirements which help to ensure that the application is at a bare minimum standard.
  - Mark your observations according to the Review Checklist, and give feedback on how an application can be improved if certain checks are not met.
  - If you have feedback outside of the scope of what the review checklist asks for, create a new comment informing the applicant about that.

For Projects:
  - It is essential for project submissions to meet at least two metric requirements in order for the submission to be complete.
  - This follows predefined badge levels.

For Events:
  - Each event will follow a [certain criteria](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/submission/event-criteria.md). Currently, there are four metric sets which can be applied for by an Event Badging applicant.
  - Event reviews go on until all the metrics the Applicant gave their statement for qualify all the given checks.
