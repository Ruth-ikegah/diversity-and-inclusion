# Reviewer Guide

## Working with checklists

A CHAOSS Badging application starts when an Applicant opens a Pull Request on either the [event](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion) or the [project](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion) badging repository. They fill out a PR template at the beginning of the PR, which contains the information a reviewer looks at. Upon being assigned that Pull Request, a checklist in the form of a comment is generated with the name of the reviewer in it.

During a review, a Reviewer would analyse the information given by an Applicant using the Review Checklist. The checklist has both quantitative and qualitative checks. There are separate checklists for both [Event](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md) and [Project](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md) reviews.

The Quantitative checks are about checking for certain types of information present in the documents/links that the applicant provides, or asking the applicant for information about specific processes. The Qualitative checks are for providing feedback on quantitative checks.

> ‚ùó If all Quantitative checks for one metric are positive, then one deliverable is met.

## Guidelines

For all submissions:
  - Make sure the Initial checks are met. These are the basic requirements which help to ensure that the application is at a bare minimum standard.
  - Mark your observations according to the Review Checklist, and give feedback on how an application can be improved if certain checks are not met.
  - If you have feedback outside of the scope of what the review checklist asks for, create a new comment informing the applicant about that.

For Projects:
  - It is essential for project submissions to meet at least three metric requirements in order to get a badge above "Pending", and projects may be resubmitted.
  - There are four Badging levels for Projects, depending on number of deliverables that are met.

For Events:
  - Each event will follow the [Event criteria](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/submission/event-criteria.md). Currently, there are four metric sets which can be applied for by an Event Badging applicant.
  - Event badges are assigned according to two Badge levels.
  - Event reviews go on until all the metrics the Applicant gave their statement for qualify all the given checks. For example, if an applicant gave their statement for adhering to Code of Conduct and Speaker Demographic metrics (which form the first metric set), their Badge status would be pending until the qualitative checks related to both these metrics are passed.
